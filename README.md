# URLockBox
## Summary
  URLockbox is a rails application that utilizes both client-side Javascript as well as traditional rails forms to allow users to create an account, add valid links, and mark these links as read or unread. The application additionally communicates with an external application which tracks the frequency at which identical URLs are visited and allows URLockbox to mark a link as being in the top 10 or the number 1 for hits: https://github.com/andrewdwooten/HotReads
